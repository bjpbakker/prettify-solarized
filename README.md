Prettify Solarized
==================

These are [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color scheme implementations 
for [Google Code Prettify](http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/).

The goal is to provide the same beautiful syntax highlighting you use in your editor for 
code snippets on your website.

See the [official Solarized homepage](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) for more 
information about Solarized and to get the color schemes for your favorite editor.

Installation
------------

Because the Solarized skin is not part of the Google Code Prettify project it cannot load 
using the autoloader (`run_prettify.js`).

Instead you must load the `prettify.js` script and run it when you page is loaded. Have a 
look at the [examples](examples) for, well, an example.

Examples
--------

See the [examples](examples) directory.
